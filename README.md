# Token Ring in Java

# Description
This is a project from the discipline "Distributed Systems". The task here was to create a simulation of a Token Ring structure.
Although I reestructed the entire code, adding comments and renaming functions and variables, most of the code isn't mine.
- The structure of the Token Ring is from our teacher, who provided us it. His code was simplier, though... Each client
had fixed doors to send the token. So, our task was mainly make it "automatic". I mean, a client enters the token ring
and he just knows who is the next door, and another process just knows that he has to send the token to the new process;
- The functions of "Get next door", "Get Previous Door" and the automatization of the process was made by a friend of mine;
- The function to test if a process is down, along with the "election" algorithm used was developed by me.

I am adding this project here 'cause I have organized all the structure of the code, and I have coded a part of it too.
